News Recommendation System

## Introduction

The News Recommendation System leverages advanced machine learning techniques to deliver personalized news articles to users. Built using Python, the system integrates various tools and libraries to process and analyze news data effectively, aiming to enhance user engagement by catering to individual preferences.

## Dataset

The dataset for this project is sourced from the MediaStack API, which provides a diverse array of categorized news articles. This rich dataset enables the system to offer a wide range of news topics, ensuring relevance and personalization in the recommendations made.

## Technologies Used

- **MediaStack API**: Accesses a broad array of news articles, providing the raw data for our system.
- **Python**: Serves as the programming language for developing the recommender system.
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)**: Utilized for text preprocessing tasks such as tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
- **Scikit-learn**: Implements algorithms for machine learning tasks, including TF-IDF vectorization and Singular Value Decomposition (SVD).
- **Streamlit**: Used to develop the interactive web application that users interact with.

## Setup and Installation

### Step 1: Download and Install Requirements

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python 3.7 or higher is installed on your machine. Visit [Python's official site](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for download and installation instructions.
   
2. **Download Project Files**: Clone or download the project files from the repository and extract them into a preferred folder.

3. **Navigate to Project Folder**: Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project folder:
   ```
   cd path_to_project_folder
   ```

4. **Install Required Libraries**: Install the necessary Python libraries specified in the requirements.txt file:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 2: File Setup

Ensure that the `MediaStack_2090.csv` file and other necessary files are located in the project directory. The directory structure should look like this:

```
News-Recommendation-System-main/
├── main.py
├── requirements.txt
├── MediaStack_2090.csv
```

### Step 3: Run the Code

Before launching the Streamlit app, initialize all required files and dependencies by running:
```
python3 main.py
```

### Step 4: Start the Streamlit Application

Launch the Streamlit application using:
```
streamlit run main.py
```

If prompted by Streamlit, you can optionally enter your email address or simply leave it blank and press Enter to continue.
