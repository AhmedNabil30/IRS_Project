# Productivity- and Season-based Agricultural Crop Recommendation Engine

## Project Overview

This project is an agricultural crop recommendation system that combines **content-based filtering** and **classification techniques** to suggest the most suitable crops. By analyzing soil nutrients, weather conditions, and seasonal data, the system assists farmers in maximizing productivity and optimizing decision-making.

## Features

### Intelligent Crop Recommendations
- **Technique Used**: Content-Based Filtering
  - Recommends crops by analyzing soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium), pH, and weather conditions (temperature, humidity, rainfall).
  - Utilizes environmental and seasonal data to ensure accurate recommendations.

### Productivity Enhancement
- Suggests strategies to maximize yield based on historical crop production data.

### Evaluation and Insights
- Evaluates the recommendation system's performance using precision and recall.
- Visualizes recommendations and predictions for user-friendly insights.
