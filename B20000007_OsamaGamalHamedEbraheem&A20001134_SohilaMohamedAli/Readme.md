Productivity- and Season-based Agricultural Crop Recommendation Engine
Project Overview
This project is an agricultural crop recommendation system that combines classification-based algorithms and regression techniques to suggest the most suitable crops based on productivity, seasonality, and environmental factors. By analyzing parameters such as soil nutrients, temperature, humidity, and rainfall, the system aids farmers in optimizing their yield and making data-driven decisions.

Features
Intelligent Crop Recommendations
Uses classification techniques to recommend crops best suited to current environmental and soil conditions.
Considers seasonal and geographical data for accurate predictions.
Productivity Enhancement
Applies regression analysis to predict crop yield based on historical production data and environmental factors.
Evaluation and Insights
Evaluates the models' performance using metrics such as accuracy and R² score.
Provides visualizations of recommendations and predictions for easy interpretation.
Datasets
The following datasets were used in this project:

Recommendation Techniques
Crop Recommendation System
Technique: Classification-based Recommendation
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier
Approach: Classifies the best crop based on input features such as soil nutrients, weather conditions, and geographical data.
Outputs: The most suitable crop for the given environmental and soil conditions.
Yield Prediction System
Technique: Regression Analysis
Algorithm: Linear Regression
Approach: Predicts the expected crop yield based on land area, season, and historical production data.
Outputs: Estimated yield in kilograms per hectare.
Outputs
Crop Recommendations
Example output: ["Rice", "Wheat", "Maize", "Barley"]
These crops are recommended based on the input conditions provided.
Model Evaluation
Crop Recommendation Model Accuracy: 95.6%
Yield Prediction Model R² Score: 89.4%
Results
The system successfully:

Recommends suitable crops based on soil and environmental parameters using classification techniques.
Predicts crop yield accurately using regression analysis for better planning.
Visualizes data and insights for effective decision-making.
