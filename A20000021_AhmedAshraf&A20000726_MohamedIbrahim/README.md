# Nutrition-aware Food Recommender Engine

## Project Overview

This project is a **hybrid food recommendation system** that combines **content-based filtering** (nutritional and ingredient similarity) and **collaborative filtering** (user ratings) to provide personalized and nutrition-aware recipe recommendations. The system helps users discover recipes that align with their dietary preferences and nutritional needs.

--- 

## Features

1. **Hybrid Recommendations:**
   - Combines **content-based filtering** (based on recipe ingredients and nutritional values) and **collaborative filtering** (based on user ratings) for personalized recommendations.

2. **Nutritional Awareness:**
   - Filters recipes based on maximum nutritional values (e.g., calories, fat, protein) to ensure recommendations meet dietary requirements.

3. **Model Evaluation:**
   - Evaluates the collaborative filtering model using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** and cross-validation to ensure accuracy and consistency.

4. **Visualization:**
   - Provides visualizations of top recommendations and nutritional distributions for better insights.

## Outputs

### Hybrid Recommendations
The system generates a list of recommended recipes based on user preferences and nutritional constraints. Hereâ€™s an example output:
Hybrid Recommendations: [500481, 6536, 444942, 314004, 469399, 9116, 336285, 373791, 3748, 3877]

### Model Evaluation
The collaborative filtering model (SVD) is evaluated using 3-fold cross-validation. Here are the results:

The table below summarizes the model's performance across three folds during cross-validation, including the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), fit time, and test time.

| Metric         | Fold 1  | Fold 2  | Fold 3  | Mean   | Std Dev |
|----------------|---------|---------|---------|--------|---------|
| RMSE (test set)| 1.2280  | 1.2278  | 1.2299  | 1.2286 | 0.0010  |
| Fit time (s)   | 19.65   | 20.12   | 20.20   | 19.99  | 0.24    |
| Test time (s)  | 4.54    | 3.21    | 3.92    | 3.89   | 0.55    |

- **Cross-Validation RMSE**: **1.2286**  
  This value represents the mean RMSE across all folds, showcasing the model's predictive accuracy.
- **Fit time**: Time taken to train the model per fold, averaged and presented with standard deviation.
- **Test time**: Time taken to evaluate the model on the test set, averaged and presented with standard deviation.

## Datasets
The following datasets were used in this project:

1. **Recipes Dataset**:
   - Contains recipe details such as `RecipeId`, `Name`, `Calories`, `FatContent`, `ProteinContent`, and `RecipeIngredientParts`.
   - **Download Link**: [Recipes Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews?select=recipes.csv)

2. **Reviews Dataset**:
   - Contains user reviews, including `AuthorId`, `RecipeId`, and `Rating`.
   - **Download Link**: [Reviews Dataset] (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews?select=reviews.csv)

### Model Details

**Content-Based Filtering**:

Uses TF-IDF vectorization to analyze recipe ingredients.

Computes cosine similarity between recipes based on nutritional values and text features.

**Collaborative Filtering**:

Uses Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) to predict user ratings.

Evaluated using RMSE and cross-validation.

**Hybrid Model**:

Combines content-based and collaborative filtering recommendations for improved accuracy and relevance.

---

### Results
The SVD model achieves an RMSE of 1.2286, indicating good predictive accuracy.

The hybrid recommendations are diverse and nutritionally balanced, as shown in the example outputs.

**Top Hybrid Recommendation**:

| RecipeId | Name         | Calories         | Fat Content       | Protein Content    | Rating             |
|----------|--------------|------------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|
| 3748     | A-To-Z Bread | 0.5365402544340938 | 0.703536973719064 | -0.5721761988149869 | 4.7727272727272725 |

- **RecipeId**: Unique identifier for each recipe.
- **Name**: Name of the recipe.
- **Calories**: Caloric value of the recipe (normalized).
- **Fat Content**: Fat content of the recipe (normalized).
- **Protein Content**: Protein content of the recipe (normalized).
- **Rating**: User rating of the recipe on a scale of 1 to 5.
